installation

caffe-windows：Reference to caffe-windows installation online.

opencv : we recommend opencv3.x(opencv2.x can also be used, just replace some functions)

vs2015/vs2013 build and run: configure the third party of caffe-windows in the project property sheet.

Source code description:：

ECO.h, ECO.cpp tracker: parameter and feature parameters intialization, label generator, cos-window function, and so on.

eco_sample_update.h, eco_sample_update.cpp: Relevant functions of updating sample model (Calculating samples distance, update sample space model, etc.)

feature_extractor.h, feature_extractor.cpp: The function of feature extraction (sampling, cnn and hog feature extractor)

feature_operator.h, feature_operator.cpp: feature operator overloading, mapping function.

fftTools.h, fftTools.cpp: Complex matrix operations, fourier domain calculation.

optimize_scores.h, optimize_scores.cpp: Calculation of the score of final features map.

training.h, training.cpp: Feature training and update class

Detailed description and description follow-up update

Supplementary：

The name of variables , functions of the classes are according to ECO matlab version. During debugging code, also you can reference to ECO Matlab version.

Vgg model is available at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1skVkPLN. After downloading, the path of the VGG folder in the main.cpp on the line 59,60,61 shall be modified.
